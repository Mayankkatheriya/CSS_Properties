*: This selector targets all elements on the page.

margin: 0;: It sets the margin of all elements to zero. This helps eliminate any default spacing that browsers might apply to certain elements.\
padding: 0;: It sets the padding of all elements to zero. Similar to the margin, this ensures that elements don't have any unintended spacing within them.\
box-sizing: border-box;: This property changes the default box-sizing behavior of elements. By setting it to border-box, the specified width and height of elements include the content, padding, and border, making it easier to calculate the overall size of elements.
